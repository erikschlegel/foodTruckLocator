# Food Truck Locator
<h2>Solution to the Food Truck Challenge</h2>
This repository contains a not quite completed solution to the Food truck locator.
<p>The included executable file will only run on a Linux machine.  The command to run the program is:<br>
<center> <strong>./foodTruck latitude longitude radius </strong> </center><br>
  where the latititude and longitude are coordinates of the user, and the radius is the maximum distance (in miles) the user is willing to go in search of a food truck. </p>
<p> Since the solution is not fully completed, all of the test cases were not run. An image of the output with orriginatiing latitude and longitude coordinates is shown below.  The command run to get the ouput is: <br>
  <center> <strong>./foodTruck 37.7749 -122.4194 2 </strong></center><br>
